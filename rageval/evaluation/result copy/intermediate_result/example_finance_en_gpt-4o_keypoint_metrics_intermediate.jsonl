This distribution impacted the net profit, reflecting the company's commitment to providing returns to its investors (Doc 1).\n\n2. **Cost Control Measures**: The net profit was influenced by effective cost control measures. These measures helped manage expenses and optimize operational efficiency, contributing positively to the net profit (Doc 1).\n\n3. **Non-Recurring Gains and Losses**: The net profit also included non-recurring gains and losses, which are one-time events that can significantly impact financial performance.
